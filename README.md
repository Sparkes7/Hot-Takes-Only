PUSHING A NEWER BRANCH
Testing pushing a new branch! - Will
This is another push - Gabby

# Project Plan

### User Stories:

- I want to see a random movie when I open the website
- I want to review the movie based on 3 categories 1-10 stars
- I want to submit these data and have them form an average score
- with other users data
- I want to be able to skip writing a hot take, but keep my star
  ratings
- I want the website to feature some animation so it feels good to use
- I want to be able to access the website on my mobile device and have
  a good experience with that
- I want an airhorn to go off when I press the submit button as
  feedback to let me know I've submitted data

### Stretch goals:

- I want to see the averages of all reviews once I've submitted my review
- I want a button to view the movie's trailer
- I want to filter the movies I see by genre

### Problem Domain

An app that gives the user a random popular movie to provide a vibe-based review, focusing on providing amusing "hot takes" and sharing these with other users.

### Planning

- after lunch: proper wireframe, problem domain, trello board
