PUSHING A NEWER BRANCH
Testing pushing a new branch! - Will
This is another push - Gabby

# Project Plan

### User Stories:

- I want to see a random movie when I open the website
- I want to assign an emoji based on feeling, to go with the Hot Take
- I want the website to feature some animation for visual feedback
- I want to be able to access the website on my mobile device and have
  a good experience on different devices
- I want a tasteful airhorn to sound when I press the submit button as
  feedback to let me know I've submitted my Hot Take
- I want to see other Hot Takes after I've submitted my own

### Stretch goals:

- add more review categories
- I want a button to view the movie's trailer
- I want to filter the movies I see by genre

### Problem Domain

An app that gives the user a random popular movie to provide a vibe-based review, focusing on providing amusing "hot takes" and sharing these with other users.

### Planning

- after lunch: proper wireframe, problem domain, trello board
